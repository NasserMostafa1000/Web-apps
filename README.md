**1. Travel Agencies**
The first web app for Karam Al-Salama Commercial Brokers to issue visas for tourists.
This project is based on REST APIs using ASP.NET Core.
The Karam Al-Salama system includes:
A public website where customers interact.
A separate desktop application installed on the company's owner's system. This desktop app is built with .NET Framework and is used to manage all items, clients, and operations independently from the website.
**Project Status and Notes**
I'm still a junior developer in React and haven't fully mastered it yet, but I'm passionate about learning and improving my skills everyday to write clean and efficient code. **My goal** is to build robust web applications and gain deeper knowledge through hands-on experience.
**Current Project Status**
This project is still in progress and has not yet been fully deployed. The main thing that remains is the integration with the payment gateway, which requires approval for the company license to enable seamless integration. In simpler terms, the project is currently waiting for the payment button on the website and hosting setup to be finalized.

**What is Complete**
The front-end and back-end integration has been completed.
The database structure and management are fully functional.
The core functionalities of the system are in place and well-tested.
Once the integration with the payment gateway is confirmed, everything else will be ready for full deployment.
