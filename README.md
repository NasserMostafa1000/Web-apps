The first web app for Karam Al-Salama Commercial Brokers to issue visas for tourists.
This project is based on REST APIs using ASP.NET Core.
The Karam Al-Salama system includes:
A public website where customers interact.
A separate desktop application installed on the company's owner's system. This desktop app is built with .NET Framework and is used to manage all items, clients, and operations independently from the website.
