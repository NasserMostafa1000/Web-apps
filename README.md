# 1. Travel Agencies

The first web app for **Karam Al-Salama Commercial Brokers** to issue visas for tourists.  
This project is based on **REST APIs** using **ASP.NET Core** as the back-end and **React** as the front-end.

The Karam Al-Salama system includes:  
- A **public website** where customers interact.  
- A **separate desktop application** installed on the company's owner's system. This desktop app is built with **.NET Framework** and is used to manage all items, clients, and operations independently from the website.

## Project Status and Notes

As a junior React developer, I am continuously enhancing my skills and striving to write clean and efficient code. My goal is to build robust web applications and gain deeper knowledge through hands-on experience.

### **Current Project Status**
This project is still in progress and has not yet been fully deployed.  
The main remaining task is the integration with the **payment gateway**, which requires approval for the company license to enable seamless integration. In simpler terms, the project is currently waiting for the **payment button** on the website and hosting setup to be finalized.

### **What is Complete**
- The **front-end and back-end integration** has been completed.  
- The **database structure and management** are fully functional.  
- The core functionalities of the system are in place and well-tested.

Once the integration with the payment gateway is confirmed, everything else will be ready for full deployment.
